# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is the sample application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

I took a detour at the beginning of The Odin Project to run through this tutorial on my own.  Given how dense it is, I'm kind of glad I did, even though TOP also uses it as a baseline.  It is like a work in progress right now.  Beyond the initial tutorial, I am making it a goal to re-write the test suite using RSpec and Cucumber as I pick up with TOP again.
